/**
 * Consider again the code from {@link org.corfudb.samples::HeloCorfu.java}:
 *
     Integer previous = map.get("a");
     if (previous == null) {
         System.out.println("This is the first time we were run!");
         map.put("a", 1);
     }
     else {
         map.put("a", ++previous);
         System.out.println("This is the " + previous + " time we were run!");
     }

 * If three program instances arrive at this code piece one after another, then the outcome would be:
    "This is the first time we were run!"<br>
    "... 2 time ..." <br>
    "... 3 time"
 *
 * What if we were to execute the above code concurrently? Try it.
 *
 * Note that there is no need to worry about the atomicity of interleaved calls to individual Corfu-object methods,
 * e.g., `map.put` and `map.get`. All Corfu-object methods are guaranteed to be atomic
 * against multi-threaded programs and concurrent program instances.
 *
 * However, there is no guarantee about the interleaving of `map.get` followed by `map.put`,
 * when invoked from concurrent program instances. Therefore, any of the following outputs are valid:
 *
 * Output 1:
    "... first time ..."<br>
    "... first time ..."<br>
    "... first time ..."

 * Output 2:
    "... first time ..."  <br>
    "... first time ..."<br>
    "... 2 time ..."

 * Output 3:
     "... first time ..."<br>
     "... 2 time ..."<br>
     "... 2 time ..."

 * Output 4:
     "... first time ..."<br>
     "... 2 time ..."<br>
     "... 3 time ..."

 * In order to enforce a consistent behavior, Corfu provides support for ACID transactions.
 * A transaction is a body of code wrapped with `TXBegin()` and `TXEnd()`.
 * For example, in the code below, we will wrap the code above with a transaction block:

     corfuRuntime.getObjectsView().TXBegin();
     Integer previous = map.get("a");
     if (previous == null) {
         System.out.println("This is the first time we were run!");
         map.put("a", 1);
     }
     else {
         map.put("a", ++previous);
         System.out.println("This is the " + previous + " time we were run!");
     }
     corfuRuntime.getObjectsView.TXEnd();

 * If we were to run three instances of this program concurrently, we would guarantee
 * a **serializable** execution order. The only valid output would be

     "... first time ..." <br>
     "... 2 time ..." <br>
     "... 3 time ..."
