### Failure Detector to detect an unstable node

In certain operational scenarios, we encounter situations where a node within a cluster repeatedly connects to and disconnects from the cluster. 
This behavior can point to potential issues when too many updates make a cluster unstable.

One proposed way to enhance the Failure Detector mechanism in Corfu is by introducing rules 
that control how often individual nodes can update the layout. 
This enhancement involves a dynamic scoring system that keeps track of each node's activity regarding layout updates. 
When a node starts making frequent layout changes, its score gradually increases. 
The higher the score, the less frequently the node is allowed to make further layout updates.

The underlying idea behind this approach is to limit the undesirable outcome of constant changes to the database layout. 
By assigning penalties to nodes with high scores, the system effectively limits their ability to carry out frequent layout modifications. 
As a result, this contributes to improving the overall stability of the Corfu db.

In practice, this scoring-based constraint mechanism represents an approach to addressing a particular scenario of an erratic node behavior, 
aligning the cluster more closely with the desired operational reliability and stability.
