/** A view of a stream implemented with address maps.
 *
 * A stream's address space is discovered by requesting to the
 * sequencer, the map of all addresses belonging to this stream.
 *
 * Notice that, unlike the BackpointerStreamView, addresses are discovered
 * in a single call to the sequencer, therefore, entries are not read
 * in advance. For this reason, when iterating over the stream (getNextEntry)
 * we perform batch reads, which significantly reduces the number of RPCs to
 * Log Units, as opposed to reading one entry at a time. Also, single stepping
 * in the presence of holes is no longer a need as address space is determined
 * by the map provided by the sequencer.
