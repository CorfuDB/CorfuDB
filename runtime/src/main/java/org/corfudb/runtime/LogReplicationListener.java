/**
 * This is the interface that a client must subscribe to if it needs to observe and bifurcate the data updates received
 * on Log Entry and Snapshot Sync.  The client's usecase is that it maintains a 'merged table' which contains data
 * received through replication and local updates.  Log Replicator does not write to this merged table.  This
 * listener will observe the writes and apply them to the merged table based on the client implementation.
 *
 *
 * This interface sees ordered updates from :
 * 1. client-streams from client-Namespace, and,
 * 2. LrStatusTable from corfuSystem-Namespace.
 *
 * The client implementing this interface will only observe the data updates from client streams
