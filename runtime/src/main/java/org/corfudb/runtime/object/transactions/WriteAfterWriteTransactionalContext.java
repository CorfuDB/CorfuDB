/** A write-after-write transactional context.

 *   <p>(1) Reads behave the same as in a regular optimistic
 *     transaction.
 *
 *   <p>(2) Writes in a write-after-write transaction are guaranteed
 *     to commit atomically, if and only if none of the objects
 *     written (the "write set") were modified between the first read
 *     ("first read timestamp") and the time of commit.
