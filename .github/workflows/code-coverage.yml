      # "-pl coverage -am" builds coverage module and also makes its dependencies thereby running their unit tests.
      #
      # Maven test failures can be ignored with "-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true" because,
      # since we are running 3 suits at once in this job, it can be time-consuming to re-run them
      # for every single intermittent/flaky test failures. Moreover, all the 3 suits are ensured to be run successfully
      # (with individual retry option) in other GitHub Action files before merging the PR.
      #
      # -Dcode-coverage=true sets the activation property to activate "it" and "universe" profiles simultaneously.
      # This system property is also used for setting the OS environment variable to be used by the server
      # shell scripts in the ITs.
      # Tip: "help:active-profiles" instead of "clean verify" lists the activated profiles along with the mvn build order.
